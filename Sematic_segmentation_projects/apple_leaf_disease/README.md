# Semantic Segmentation Project

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a **Semantic Segmentation** model using deep learning techniques. The project focuses on segmenting objects in images and assigning each pixel a class label, enabling precise object recognition and localization.

## Features
- **Deep Learning-Based Segmentation**: Utilizes state-of-the-art neural networks for segmentation tasks.
- **Preprocessing Techniques**: Includes data augmentation, normalization, and resizing for better generalization.
- **Model Training & Evaluation**: Implements a robust training pipeline with metrics such as IoU (Intersection over Union) and Dice Score.
- **Visualization Tools**: Uses Grad-CAM and overlay techniques to interpret model predictions.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

### Setup
Clone the repository and install the dependencies:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/segmentation_project.git
cd segmentation_project
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
### Training the Model
Run the following command to train the model:
```sh
python train.py --epochs 50 --batch_size 16 --lr 0.001
```

### Evaluating the Model
To evaluate the trained model:
```sh
python evaluate.py --model_path models/best_model.pth
```

### Running Inference
For segmenting images using a trained model:
```sh
python inference.py --image_path sample.jpg --model_path models/best_model.pth
```

## Results
The model achieves high accuracy in segmentation tasks, visualized through overlayed mask predictions.
