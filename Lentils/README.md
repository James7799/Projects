# Image Classification with CNN using Kaggle Dataset

## Overview
This project demonstrates image classification using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The dataset is downloaded from Kaggle, preprocessed, and used to train a deep learning model. The project includes data analysis, model training, and evaluation.

## Features
- Download dataset from Kaggle
- Data preprocessing and augmentation
- Custom PyTorch dataset class
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- CNN model implementation
- Model training and evaluation

## Requirements
Before running the project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Key Dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- pandas
- matplotlib
- numpy
- Kaggle API

## Dataset
The dataset is downloaded from Kaggle using the Kaggle API. Ensure you have your Kaggle API key configured:

1. Download the Kaggle API key from your [Kaggle account](https://www.kaggle.com/)
2. Place `kaggle.json` in `~/.kaggle/` (Linux/Mac) or `C:\Users\<YourUser>\.kaggle\` (Windows)

Run the script to download the dataset:
```bash
python download_dataset.py
```

## Usage
### 1. Preprocess the Data
Run the preprocessing script to prepare the dataset:
```bash
python preprocess.py
```

### 2. Train the Model
To train the CNN model, execute:
```bash
python train.py
```

### 3. Evaluate the Model
Evaluate the trained model with:
```bash
python evaluate.py
```
